# Predict Steph Curry's Shots
 In this project, I used a dataset with all Steph Curry's NBA field goal attempts from October 2009 through June 2019 (regular season and playoffs). The dataset was collected with the nba_api Python library.  I created a model to predict whether Curry will make a shot based on his past perfomance.

This notebook contains 10 tasks, Here's a summary:

Task 1: Importing data.
Task 2: Feature engineering.
Task 3: Splitting data into a feature matrix and target vector.
Task 4: Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
Task 5: Establishing baseline accuracy.
Task 6: Building a model with a transformer and a tree-based predictor.
Task 7: Calculating training and validation accuracy.
Task 8 (stretch goal): Tuning model hyperparameters.
Task 9: Calculating precision and recall from a confusion matrix.
Task 10 (stretch goal): Plotting a confusion matrix.
